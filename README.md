# Cardioid Curve Animation P5.JS

- A cardioid (from the Greek καρδία "heart") is a plane curve traced by a point on the perimeter of a circle that is rolling around a fixed circle of the same radius

- It can also be defined as an epicycloid having a single cusp. It is also a type of sinusoidal spiral, and an inverse curve of the parabola with the focus as the center of inversion

- Adding strokes() inside of circles() to demonstrate the cardioid curve properties with P5.JS

- Every 100 iterations stroke(r,g,b) is changed
